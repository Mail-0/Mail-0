# Mail0.io 🚀

An Open-Source Gmail Alternative for the Future of Email

## What is Mail0.io?

Mail0.io is an open-source email solution that gives users the power to **self-host** their own email servers while also integrating external services like Gmail and other email providers. Our goal is to put **control, privacy, and customization** back into the hands of users—whether they choose to host their email independently or manage multiple inboxes from a single, customizable platform.

## Why Mail0.io?

Most email services today are either **closed-source**, **data-hungry**, or **too complex to self-host**. Mail0.io is different:

✅ **Fully Open-Source** – No hidden agendas, no walled gardens. 100% transparency.  
🔒 **Data Privacy First** – Your emails, your data. No tracking, no selling, no middlemen.  
⚙️ **Self-Hosting Freedom** – Run your own email server with ease.  
📬 **Unified Inbox** – Connect multiple email providers like Gmail, Outlook, and more.  
🎨 **Customizable UI & Features** – Tailor your email experience the way you want it.  
🚀 **Developer-Friendly** – Built with extensibility and integrations in mind.

## Our Mission

We believe email should be:

1. **Yours** – You control where your data is stored.
2. **Flexible** – Use it however you want—self-hosted or connected to third-party providers.
3. **Open** – Transparent development, open collaboration, and community-driven innovation.
4. **User-Friendly** – No need for technical expertise to get started.

## Roadmap 🛤️

We're in the early stages of development, and we’re shaping the future of Mail0.io **together with the community**. Some key areas we will focus on:

- **Core Email Server** – A lightweight, reliable self-hosted email server.
- **Email Client** – A sleek, customizable web app for managing emails.
- **Gmail & External Email Integration** – Support for linking third-party email services.
- **Privacy-Focused Features** – Encryption, tracking protection, and secure authentication.
- **Developer API** – Extensible tools for building integrations and automations.

## Join the Movement 🚀

Mail0.io is not just another email app—it's a **vision** for a better, more open, and user-controlled email ecosystem. If you believe in **privacy**, **open-source software**, and **giving users control**, we’d love for you to join us!
